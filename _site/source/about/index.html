<p>Hi, I&#8217;m David E. Wheeler, a.k.a. &#8220;theory&#8221;, a.k.a. <a href='https://metacpan.org/author/DWHEELER' title='DWHEELER&apos;s CPAN Distributions'>DWHEELER</a> on CPAN. I&#8217;ve been hacking Perl since 1995, when I first started programming. Perl was my first language, and still my favorite. <a href='/'>theory.pm</a> is my Perl blog. I also have a <a href='http://justatheory.com/' title='Just a Theory'>personal blog</a>.</p>
